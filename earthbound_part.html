        <p>Hi! This is the Earthbound part of the Legends of Localization in Romanian. So lets get started!&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The funniest and most annoying part of translating Earthbound is that I have to translate SO much shop dialogue.&nbsp;I mean it's not a problem but you know, it's annoying&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As I'm writing this, I have translated, mostly, just shop dialogue and maybe a little non-shop dialogue. It is annoying but its still progress.&nbsp;</p> 
        <p>The thing you'll see the most is "pt". Why is that when it's supposed to be a full word? Well because of Romanian's long words.&nbsp;Just the word for, for is 6 letters. So I have to use the shortend "word" instead of the full word.&nbsp;</p>
